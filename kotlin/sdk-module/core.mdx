# Core
A robust user authentication system is implemented to ensure our platform's security and privacy. User credentials are securely stored and encrypted using industry-standard methods. Access control is enforced through carefully managed permissions, granting users access only to features and functionalities based on the entitlements. This approach adheres to stringent security and data protection standards. Personalized services are provided by leveraging stored credentials, allowing for tailored user experiences. It is important to note that authentication is mandatory for utilizing any functionality within the TruvideoSDK. 
 
:::note Note

Please note that authentication is a prerequisite for utilizing any functionality within the TruvideoSDK.

:::

### Adding Module
Include the following dependency in your gradle file 
```swift
implementation 'com.github.Truvideo:truvideo-sdk-android-core:0.2.03'
```
Ensure the inclusion of the jitpack repository in the setting. gradle file

```swift
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://jitpack.io'
        }
    }
}
```
### Required permissions
To access internet service you need to add the below code to AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### Authentication Status
The Truvideo SDK provides two properties that serve to check the authentication status: 
- isAuthenticated : Returns true or false indicating whether the client is authenticated. Please note that authentication may be expired.
- isAuthenticationExpired : Return true or false indicating whether the authentication is expired. If the client is not authenticated, it always returns false.
```kotlin
val isAuthenticated = TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticated
val isAuthenticationExpired = TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticationExpired
```
How to authenticate 
The authenticate method requires the following inputs:
1. ApiKey: A string provided by Truvideo upon registration.
2. Payload: Essential data containing device information, generated internally using the generatePayload() function.
3. Signature: Encrypt the payload with the provided secret key using the SHA256 algorithm to regenerate the signature.

Upon completion, it triggers the onReady callback or the onError callback in case of an error.

:::note
The API key and Secret key are provided by the TRUVideo SDK team.
:::

### Algorithm for encoding the signature:
The encoding algorithm operates by taking the secret key and payload as inputs, generating an encoded string suitable for authentication purposes.
```kotlin
fun toSha256String(secret: String, payload: String): String? {
   return try {
       // getting instance of Message Authentication Code
       val hmacSha256 = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256") 
       //secretKey
       val secretKey = SecretKeySpec(secret.toByteArray(), "HmacSHA256")         
       hmacSha256.init(secretKey)
       val macData = hmacSha256.doFinal(payload.toByteArray())
       // Convert byte array to hex string
       val hexString = StringBuilder()
       for (b in macData) {
           val hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff and b.toInt())
           if (hex.length == 1) {
               hexString.append('0')
           }
           hexString.append(hex)
       }
       hexString.toString() //return encoded string
   } catch (e: NoSuchAlgorithmException) {
       e.printStackTrace()
       null
   } catch (e: InvalidKeyException) {
       e.printStackTrace()
       null
   }
}
```
:::note
We suggest avoiding storing the secret within the host application. Instead, set up a private backend owned by you. This backend will handle the payload from the Truvideo SDK and generate the signature. By doing this, you can prevent the secret from being exposed, reducing the risk of security issues
:::

```kotlin
fun authenticate(context : ComponentActivity) {
   // Check if a user is authenticated
   val isAuthenticated = TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticated
   // Check if the authentication token has expired
   val isAuthenticationExpired = TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticationExpired
   Log.d("TAG", "authenticate: $isAuthenticated isExp $isAuthenticationExpired")
   if (!isAuthenticated || isAuthenticationExpired) {
       //Get API key and secret key
       val apiKey = context.resources.getString(R.string.api_key)
       // generate payload for authentication
       val payload = TruvideoSdk.generatePayload()
       val signature = context.resources.getString(R.string.secret_key)
       // generate SHA-256 hash of payload with signature as secret key
       val sha256 = toSha256String(signature, payload)
       // Authenticate user
       TruvideoSdk.authenticate(apiKey, payload, sha256!!, object :
           TruvideoSdkAuthenticationCallback {
           override fun onReady() {
               Log.d("TAG", "onReady: ")
               // If the user is authenticated successfully
           }

           override fun onError(e: TruvideoSdkException) {
               Log.d("TAG", "onError: ")
               // If user authentication failed
           }
       }
       )
   } else {
       TruvideoSdk.init(object : TruvideoSdkInitCallback {
           override fun onReady() {
               Log.d("TAG", "onReady: false")
               // If the user is authenticated successfully
           }

           override fun onError(e: TruvideoSdkException) {
               // If user authentication failed
           }
       }
       )
   }
}
```
### Clear Authentication
To delete the current session and erase all associated authentication data, utilize the clear method 

```kotlin
TruvideoSdk.clear()
```
