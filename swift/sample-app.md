# Sample App
**Descriptions**

The sample app contains a complete and fully working implementation of the TruVideo Android SDK. In the app, you can see how the setup is done and how the SDK works. Just add an app key and secret key from one of your apps to the string resource file function before you start the sample app.

The sample app can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/5Exceptions-Mobile-Team/truvideo-ios-sample-app.git).
