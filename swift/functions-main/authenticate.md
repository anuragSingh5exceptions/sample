# Authenticate
**Description**

The `authenticate` function is used for initializing the SDK. Before calling this function, make sure that you have set the event listeners, otherwise, no authentication events can be triggered.

**Syntax**
```swift
TruvideoSdk.authenticate(apiKey: Constant.apiKey, payload: payload, signature: signature)
```
`apiKey` (required) String :
    The unique API key that will be provided by Truvideo team 

`payload` (required) String :
   The payload is a string that can be generated by generatePayload()

`signature` (required) String :
   The signature is a string that is generated by encoding payload with SHA256 using a secret key

**Return value**

None

**Example**
```swift
func authenticate(){
        /// Verify if the user is already authenticated or if the session is active or expired..
        if(!TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticated || TruvideoSdk.isAuthenticationExpired){
            
            let payload = TruvideoSdk.generatePayload()
            /// The payload string is transformed into an encrypted string using the SHA256 algorithm.
            let signature = payload.toSha256String(using: Constant.secretKey)
            
            Task(operation: {
                do{
                    ///   Initialize a session when the user is not authenticated.
                    /// - Parameters:
                    ///     - API_Key : Provided by TruVideo team
                    ///     - Payload : generated by sdk TruvideoSdk.generatePayload() every time you have to create new payload
                    ///     - Signature: encrypted string payload using the SHA256 algorithm with "secret key"
                    ///     - Secret_Key: secret key is also provided by TruVideo team
                    try await TruvideoSdk.authenticate(apiKey: Constant.apiKey, payload: payload, signature: signature)
                }catch {
                }
            })
        }else{
            Task(operation: {
                do{
                    /// Initialize a session when the user is already authenticated.
                    try await TruvideoSdk.´init´()
                }catch {
                }
            })
        }
    }
